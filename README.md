## Proposal
The script used to calculate the results of this election can be used — with some modifications — for any election. Here's how the script should be modified: 

### Change File To Load
The path to the .csv file that holds the raw election data will need to change to support new election data.

The path to the .txt file that is used to write the election results will need to change to support new election results.
